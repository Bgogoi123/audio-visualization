# 🎧 Spectranaut

**Spectranaut** is an interactive audio visualization tool that transforms any audio file into a live spectrogram. With a variety of color themes and support for local file uploads, Spectranaut brings sound to life—visually.

## What is a Spectogram?

A **Spectrogram** is a visual representation of the frequencies present in a sound over time. It displays frequency on the vertical axis, time on the horizontal axis, and the intensity (amplitude) of each frequency is represented by color or brightness.

## 🚀 Spectranaut Features

- 🔊 Upload or select built-in audio files to visualize.
- 🎨 Choose from a variety of dynamic color themes.

- 🖱️ Click-to-play/pause interface.
- 🌈 HSLA-based theming for smooth visual gradients.
